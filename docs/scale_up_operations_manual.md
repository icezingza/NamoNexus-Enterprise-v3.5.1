# Scale‑Up Operations Manual (Months 7‑24)

Purpose: Provide an executable roadmap for operational scaling after pilot success.  
Audience: Operations lead, clinical lead, and executive leadership.

## Scale Readiness Criteria

Scale begins only when the following are true:

- 6‑week pilot completed with stable metrics  
- First paying customer signed (hospital or CSR partner)  
- Go/no‑go decision passed and leadership approved expansion

## Operating Principles

- Safety‑first, human‑in‑the‑loop at all times  
- PDPA compliance with audit logging and data minimization  
- Thai FDA SaMD Class 3 alignment  
- Reliability targets: 99%+ uptime, <3 sec response time

## Phase Plan (Month 7‑24)

| Phase | Timeline | Customers | Key Focus | Estimated Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 | Month 7-8 | 1 customer | Dedicated support, feedback loop, case study | ~100K THB/month |
| Phase 2 | Month 9-12 | 3-5 customers | Standardize onboarding, self‑service docs | ~200K THB/month |
| Phase 3 | Month 13-18 | 10+ customers | Partner program, sales enablement, infra optimization | ~400K THB/month |
| Phase 4 | Month 18-24 | 50+ customers | Regional teams, support portal, ecosystem APIs | ~800K THB/month |

## Revenue Targets

| Milestone | Revenue Target |
| --- | --- |
| Month 7 | 1 customer = 200K THB/month |
| Month 12 | 5 customers = 1M+ THB/month |
| Month 18 | 20 customers = 4–5M THB/month |
| Month 24 | 50+ customers = 10M+ THB/month |

## Key Hires (Timing)

| Role | Target Month | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ops lead | Month 8 | Scale execution and delivery |
| Support lead | Month 10 | SLA ownership and training |
| Sales lead | Month 12 | Pipeline and partnerships |
| Product manager | Month 15 | Roadmap, evidence, and feedback |

## Customer Onboarding Playbook

| Step | Timeline | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery + scoping | Week 1-2 | Success metrics + workflow map |
| Integration design | Week 3-4 | Data flows + security review |
| Configuration | Week 5-6 | Triage rules + escalation SLA |
| Training | Week 7 | 2‑hour counselor training |
| Go‑live | Week 8 | Controlled rollout + monitoring |

## Support Model and SLAs

| Tier | Response Time | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | < 4 hours | User questions, workflow support |
| L2 | < 24 hours | Configuration, data corrections |
| L3 | < 48 hours | Engineering fixes, system updates |

Critical incidents: immediate escalation to leadership with 24/7 coverage.

## Quality, Safety, and Compliance

- Weekly safety review of all escalations  
- Monthly policy calibration (triage and language)  
- Quarterly risk assessment (ISO 14971 alignment)  
- Incident response: Detect → Contain → Analyze → Fix → Learn  
- Release gates: QA, safety review, and clinical sign‑off

## Infrastructure and Reliability

- Stateless services with horizontal scaling  
- Load testing before every phase expansion  
- Centralized logging and audit trails  
- Backups and disaster recovery plan  
- Performance target: <2 sec median response, <3 sec p95

## Customer Success Metrics

- NPS >= 50  
- Annual retention >= 90%  
- Expansion: 20% of customers upgrade tiers  
- Churn < 10% annually  
- Safety: zero unresolved critical incidents

## Key Risks and Mitigations

- Adoption delays → strengthen onboarding and training  
- Integration complexity → standard APIs + BMS partnership  
- Compliance risk → PDPA audits and documentation control

## Next Steps

1. Confirm scale readiness with Week 6 metrics.  
2. Hire ops lead and finalize onboarding playbook.  
3. Launch Phase 1 customer with dedicated support.  
4. Prepare Phase 2 documentation and training assets.
