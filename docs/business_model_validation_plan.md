# Business Model Validation Plan

## Objective
Validate pricing, market fit, and revenue assumptions before committing to the 18-month FDA pathway.

## Current Risks

### 1) Pricing Assumptions Not Validated
Current projections:
```
Private Hospital: 750K-1M THB/month
Corporate CSR: 500K THB/month
Government: 15-25M THB/year
```

Risk: No customer has agreed to these prices.

Validation needed:
- Get 3 LOIs (Letters of Intent) at target pricing
- Or adjust pricing based on willingness-to-pay research

### 2) Revenue Timeline Optimistic
```
Year 1: 5M-10M THB
Year 2: 15M-25M THB (break-even)
Year 3: 30M-40M THB
```

Reality check:
- Thai FDA takes 18 months minimum
- First paying customer realistically: Month 12-15
- Break-even at Year 2 assumes rapid adoption (risky)

Recommendation: Conservative scenario planning.

## Validation Framework (12 Weeks)

### Week 1-4: Customer Discovery
Goal: Talk to 20+ potential customers.

Target interviews:
- 5 Private Hospitals (CEO, Clinical Director, IT Director)
  - Questions: Budget? Pain points? Willingness to pay?
  - Goal: 2 warm leads
- 3 Corporate CSR leaders
  - Questions: ESG priorities? Mental health budget?
  - Goal: 1 pilot interest
- 2 Government officials (DMH, NHSO)
  - Questions: Budget cycle? Procurement process?
  - Goal: Understand timeline and requirements

Deliverable:
- Interview summary report
- Revised pricing strategy
- Target customer profiles

### Week 5-8: Proof of Concept
Goal: Demonstrate value with minimal investment.

Option A: 1323 pilot (preferred)
- Scope: 6-week supervised pilot
- Investment: ~100K THB
- Success metrics:
  - Triage accuracy >= 90%
  - Counselor satisfaction >= 80%
  - Zero critical safety incidents

Option B: Private hospital alpha
- Scope: 4-week alpha test with 1 hospital
- Investment: ~200K THB
- Success metrics:
  - Documentation time reduced >= 30%
  - Clinician satisfaction >= 75%
  - Zero workflow disruptions

Deliverable:
- Pilot report with real metrics
- Customer testimonial
- Case study draft

### Week 9-12: Commercial Validation
Goal: Get first paying customer or LOI.

Pricing experiments:

| Tier | Discount Strategy | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Early Adopter | 50% off Year 1 | Get 1 signed contract |
| Pilot-to-Paid | 3 months free, then 25% off | Convert pilot customer |
| Government RFP | Bulk pricing (volume-based) | Submit proposal |

Success criteria:
- Minimum: 1 LOI at >= 50% of target price
- Target: 1 paid contract
- Stretch: 3 warm pipeline opportunities

Deliverable:
- Signed LOI or contract
- Updated financial projections
- Go/no-go decision for FDA pathway

## Pricing Sensitivity Analysis

### Scenario 1: Conservative (Recommended)
```
Private Hospital: 300K THB/month (60% discount)
Corporate CSR: 250K THB/month (50% discount)
Government: Wait until Year 2 (too complex for Year 1)

Year 1 Revenue: 2-3M THB (1 hospital + 1 CSR)
Year 2 Revenue: 8-12M THB (5 hospitals + 3 CSR)
Break-even: Year 3
```

Rationale: Market education takes time. Start small, prove value, then scale.

### Scenario 2: Optimistic (Current Plan)
```
Private Hospital: 750K THB/month
Corporate CSR: 500K THB/month
Government: 15M THB/year

Year 1 Revenue: 5-10M THB
Year 2 Revenue: 15-25M THB
Break-even: Year 2
```

Risk: Requires faster adoption than typical SaaS in healthcare.

### Scenario 3: Pessimistic (Contingency)
```
Private Hospital: 150K THB/month (pilot pricing)
Corporate CSR: Not interested (wrong value prop)
Government: RFP delayed to Year 3

Year 1 Revenue: 500K-1M THB
Year 2 Revenue: 3-5M THB
Break-even: Year 4+
```

Action: If this scenario materializes, pivot strategy or seek additional funding.

## Decision Gates

### Gate 1 (Week 4): Customer Interest
Pass criteria:
- 10+ completed interviews
- 2+ warm leads identified
- Clear understanding of buyer pain points

Fail: Pivot value proposition or target customer.

### Gate 2 (Week 8): Proof of Value
Pass criteria:
- Pilot completed successfully
- Metrics meet targets
- Customer willing to continue

Fail: Fix product or pause commercialization.

### Gate 3 (Week 12): Commercial Validation
Pass criteria:
- 1+ LOI or contract signed
- Pricing validated at >= 50% of target
- Clear path to 5 customers in Year 1

Fail: Revise business model or seek strategic partner.

## Budget for Validation

| Activity | Cost (THB) | Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer interviews | 50K | Week 1-4 |
| 1323 Pilot | 100K | Week 5-8 |
| Legal (contracts, LOIs) | 50K | Week 9-12 |
| Marketing materials | 30K | Week 9-12 |
| Total | 230K | 12 weeks |

ROI: If successful, de-risks a 6-12M THB FDA investment.
