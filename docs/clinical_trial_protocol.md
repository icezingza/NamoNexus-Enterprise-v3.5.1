# Clinical Trial Protocol: NamoNexus CDS Safety and Triage Accuracy

## Study Title
NamoNexus Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Safety and Triage Accuracy Study

## Audience
This protocol is prepared for IRB submission and is aligned with Thai FDA SaMD Class 3 and CSDT expectations.

## Study Overview
NamoNexus is a Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system for mental health triage. It is not an autonomous crisis response system. All outputs require human approval and Tier 2-3 escalations are mandatory.

## Objectives
### Primary Objective
- Measure triage accuracy of NamoNexus CDS versus a human baseline.

### Secondary Objectives
- Measure user satisfaction.
- Measure safety outcomes and escalation timeliness.
- Measure operational impact (counselor time saved).

## Study Design
- Design: Prospective, multi-site, supervised CDS validation study.
- Sample size: 200-300 participants.
- Duration: 6 months data collection.
- Sites: One Bangkok hospital and one regional center (to be confirmed).
- Oversight: IRB approval required before recruitment.

## Population
### Inclusion Criteria
- Adults age 18-65.
- Mild to moderate distress based on screening tools (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7).
- Able to provide informed consent.
- Access to a supported device.

### Exclusion Criteria
- Acute crisis or imminent self-harm risk at baseline.
- Active psychosis or mania requiring immediate intervention.
- Unmanaged substance dependence.

## Intervention
Participants interact with NamoNexus CDS during hotline or clinic sessions. Counselors review and approve all CDS suggestions. Tier 2-3 signals are escalated immediately to supervisors per SLA.

## Endpoints
| Endpoint Type | Measure | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | Triage accuracy | Agreement between CDS tier and clinician consensus baseline |
| Secondary | User satisfaction | Post-session rating |
| Secondary | Safety | False negative rate and escalation timeliness |
| Secondary | Operational | Counselor time saved per session |

## Baseline and Comparator
- Human baseline is defined by a clinician consensus panel.
- CDS triage outputs are compared against consensus labels.

## Safety and Escalation
- Mandatory Tier 2-3 escalation to supervisors.
- Escalation SLAs tracked (time-to-review).
- Weekly safety review committee.
- Immediate incident review for any false negatives.

## Data Management and PDPA Compliance
- Pseudonymized identifiers used for all datasets.
- Minimal data collection for triage and audit purposes.
- Access controls and audit logging for all data actions.
- Retention aligned with PDPA and partner policy.

## Regulatory Alignment
- Thai FDA SaMD Class 3 expectations.
- CSDT-aligned evidence planning.
- Human-in-the-loop CDS design emphasized in labeling and protocol.

## Timeline
| Month | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 1-2 | Site selection, protocol finalization, IRB submission |
| 3-8 | Enrollment and data collection |
| 9 | Analysis and final report |

## IRB and Ethics
- IRB approval is mandatory before recruitment.
- Consent includes disclosure that NamoNexus is CDS-only and not autonomous.
- Participants can withdraw at any time without impact on care.

## Reporting and Analysis Plan
- Triage accuracy reported as percent agreement and kappa.
- Safety outcomes reported as rates with confidence intervals.
- User satisfaction reported as mean rating and distribution.

## Next Steps
- Confirm participating hospital sites and clinical PI.
- Finalize consent language and disclosure scripts.
- Submit protocol to IRB for approval.
